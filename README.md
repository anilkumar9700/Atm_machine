Development of an ATM Interface in Java

Task Description: 
The task is to develop an ATM interface program in Java that allows users to perform various banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. The program should prompt users to enter their user ID and PIN for authentication upon startup. Upon successful authentication, users should gain access to the ATM functionalities. Error handling mechanisms should be implemented to handle invalid user input, insufficient funds, etc. The program should provide informative messages to guide users through the ATM interface.

 Steps Taken:
•	Researched existing ATM interface implementations in Java.
•	Designed the structure of the ATM interface program, including user authentication and banking functionalities.
•	Implemented user input handling for user ID and PIN authentication.
•	Created classes for User and ATM to encapsulate data and functionality.
•	Implemented basic ATM functionalities such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money.
•	Tested the program with various scenarios to ensure functionality and reliability.

 Challenges Faced:
•	Understanding and implementing proper error handling mechanisms.
•	Integrating user authentication seamlessly into the program flow.
•	Ensuring secure handling of sensitive user data like PINs.

Solutions Implemented:
•	Researched best practices for error handling in Java and implemented try-catch blocks to handle exceptions.
•	Utilized conditional statements to control the flow of the program based on the success or failure of user authentication.
•	Used secure methods for handling sensitive data, such as storing hashed PINs instead of plaintext.
 Learnings:
•	Improved understanding of Java programming concepts, including classes, methods, and exception handling.
•	Learned about the importance of secure coding practices, especially when dealing with sensitive user information.
•	Gained experience in designing and implementing a user-friendly interface for a software application.

 Project Update:
   The ATM interface program is now fully functional, allowing users to perform banking operations such as checking balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. Error handling mechanisms have been implemented to handle invalid user input and ensure the reliability of the program. Further testing will be conducted to identify and resolve any remaining issues before final deployment.
